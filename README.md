# PURPOSE OF THIS REPO

This repository contains the proposal for a social regulatory process/methodology called CAIRM (Collaborative Agile Intuitive Regulation Management).
CAIRM was originally conceived as an application for a private grant to regulate AI, with other applicable use cases in IT security risk management.
The application was however discarded. Its draft was posted here so it could be freely reused for the same or other purposes.
